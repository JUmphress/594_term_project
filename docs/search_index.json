["literature-review.html", "Chapter 3 Literature Review 3.1 Large-Scale Ridesourcing Trends 3.2 Ridesourcing Trends in Cities", " Chapter 3 Literature Review Ridesharing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi have become an increasingly popular mode of transportation within the last few years. Ridesharing allows travelers to digitally hail drivers and pay for rides, usually by using a smartphone app. Ridesharing fits into a unique niche as a transportation mode. It provides many advantages typically offered by car ownership but bypasses the cost of buying a car or other inconveniences such as finding parking. It offers a much higher level of convenience than taxis or traditional transit forms such as buses or trains by picking up and dropping off riders at the desired locations, often at competitive prices. This literature seeks to understand the work that has been done to understand the relationship between ridesharing use and transit use. 3.1 Large-Scale Ridesourcing Trends Observation of ridesharing on a broad scale can identify general trends between ridesharing and transit ridership. Diab et al. (2020) studied the effects of various factors on transit ridership in Canada. Data were collected from a wide range of sources and used to generate three models- one for all transit agencies in Canada, one for the agencies with over 1.2 million linked trips in 2016, and one for agencies with less than 1.2 million linked trips in 2016. Variation was studied within agencies over time and between agencies at the same times. Variables within the model were selected based on statistically significant correlations. The models suggest that overall, the presence of Uber in areas with large transit systems is correlated with small increases in transit ridership, but in areas with smaller transit systems this is correlated with a decrease in transit ridership. Based on this study, it is not completely clear whether ridesharing directly affects transit use or if conditions that negatively impact transit use also happen to be more beneficial for ridesharing. Areas with higher transit availability will naturally receive higher ridership, but if transit is more available for reasons such as higher population density, it also stands to reason that ridesharing would also be a popular mode choice in the same area. Similarly, ridership will decrease in areas with less coverage, while ridesharing does not face the same problems with long headways. However, though the changes to ridership associated with ridesharing are small, ridesharing is among the more statistically significant variables in the model. Leard and Xing (2020) used the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) to create a choice model that would estimate mode choices if ridesharing were no longer an option. Ridesharing was identified as primarily replacing driving cars, though it did also have effects on other modes such as biking and taxi riding. The biggest cost to transit systems was shown in some larger cities, where ridesharing replaced more transit usage than individual car rides. This contrasts the conclusions drawn by Diab et al., where the presence of ridesharing had some minor benefit for large transit systems but also tended to detract from smaller transit systems. However, other large cities confirm the results from Diab et al., as ridesharing almost exclusively replaced car driving. These differences are likely due to differences in mode preference habits and existing mode options in the cities tested. 3.2 Ridesourcing Trends in Cities Studying rideshare uses in specific areas can provide greater clarity on specific relationships. Welch, Gehrke, and Widita (2020) compared train, bikeshare, and taxi use in the Washington, DC metropolitan region, with ridesharing classified within the taxi category due to limits in available data on ridesharing. Competition with the local transit system was isolated by identifying bikeshare and taxi trips that had both origins and destinations within a quarter-mile radius of train stops. Multinomial logit modelling indicated that increases in train fare significantly increased the likelihood of travelers choosing bikeshare or taxi as a travel mode. Trains were still the most commonly used mode, followed by taxis and then bikeshares. Train ridership was much heavier in peak periods than the other modes, while taxi usage became the dominant mode during evening non-peak periods. Furthermore, train ridership was primarily used for work commutes, while bikesharing and taxi were more likely to be used for other types of trips. Zgheib, Abou-Zeid, and Kaysi (2020) studied the potential for ridesharing as a means of accessing transit services, including addressing the first-mile last-mile problem. Data was collected through a survey in preparation for the installation of a bus rapid transit (BRT) system in the Beirut area in Lebanon. This data was then used to create a mode choice model. Model results suggested that in-vehicle travel time using ridesharing services were less preferable than similar amounts of in-vehicle travel time on BRT. However, ridesharing was still viewed as more reliable than BRT. Ridesharing was more popular among younger populations. Unfortunately, the survey only included travelers who already owned cars, making it impossible to estimate the effects of ridesharing on those who might typically rely more heavily on transit. Mohamed, Rye, and Fonzone (2020) conducted a study in London by issuing detailed surveys to UberX and Uberpool riders. Like the study conducted by Zgheib, Abou-Zeid, and Kaysi (2020), survey data showed that ridesharing is used primarily by younger people, with the vast majority of UberX riders and over half of Uberpool riders under the age of 36, and a low fraction of riders in their fifties or older. Social activities were named as the leading trip attraction for rideshare users, with work being the next most common attraction. The survey results suggest that in London, rideshare users primarily used public transit prior to ridesharing. While the relationship between transit and rideshare use when traveling in a large urban area is still unclear as shown by Leard and Xing (2020), London’s well-established transit network was generally the preferred mode of choice, so it stands to reason that ridesharing would draw more riders from public transit than from driving. The three main reasons for choosing ridesharing were speed, not travelling with strangers, and reliability, all of which are common complaints against transit. Brown (2020) studied ridesharing patterns in Los Angeles county in California using data from Lyft. Two models were created, one searching for patterns in locations involved in ridesharing and one searching for patterns in the types of individuals who used ridesharing services. Ridesharing was more common in medium- and high-density neighborhoods, and it was more common in low-income neighborhoods than medium- or high-income neighborhoods. Brown also confirmed Zgheib, Abou-Zeid, and Kaysi (2020) and Mohamed, Rye, and Fonzone (2020) in observing that ridesharing was more common among younger riders than older riders. Brown also observed that the majority of Lyft trips were taken by a minority of Lyft users, or in other words, a small group of individuals frequently rideshare while a larger group of individuals may occasionally rideshare. Kong, Zhang, and Zhao (2020) studied ridesharing patterns in Chengdu, China, for the ridesharing company Didi. In addition to data from Didi, information was gathered regarding the public transit system and the built environment. Like the study conducted by Welch, Gehrke, and Widita (2020) in Washington, DC, Kong et al. identified ridesharing’s potential to replace transit by tracking origins and destinations that were similar in location to transit stops. In addition to transit coverage, travel times and service quality were considered when evaluating whether ridesharing complemented or replaced transit. Based on the time of day for trips taken, it was observed that during the day (7:00 am to 8:00 pm) ridesharing mostly took place within close proximity to public transit stops, while for the rest of the time ridesharing complemented public transit by travelling to more obscure locations. Ridesharing was concluded to decrease transit ridership in areas with greater coverage, but it complemented transit ridership in areas with poorer coverage. Overall, an average of about one-third of Didi trips were identified as likely replacements for transit. Day travel is more likely to see Didi replace transit than night travel is. Overall, a wide range of factors seem to affect the relationship between ridesharing and public transit use. Data such as rider age, public transit coverage, time of day, and many other pieces of information all relate to how ridesharing is used. References "],
["data.html", "Chapter 4 Data", " Chapter 4 Data The data for this study comes from the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Surveys (NHTS). The NHTS collects detailed data on travel behavior within the United States by surveying selected regions and adjusting the data to represent trends in the country as a whole. The data can be classified as being collected to describe households, persons, workers, vehicles, and trips. Some data categories are added and removed from between different iterations of the NHTS, but most categories remain consistent. The data collected for households includes the number of people, drivers, workers, and vehicles, the income, the housing type, whether the residence is owned or rented, the race and hispanic status of the household reference person, the tract and block group characteristics, and internet use and delivery. The 2009 NHTS also includes information about the number of cell phones and other phones in the household, but the 2017 NHTS does not. The data collected on persons includes the age, sex, relationship to the reference person, driver status, worker status or primary occupation, internet use, home deliveries from internet shopping, travel disability, effects of disability on mobility, education level, immigrant status, views on transportation, annual number of miles driven, public transit and motorcycle in the last month, and biking and walking trips in the last week. The 2009 NHTS includes school trips for children and individual internet use, while the 2017 NHTS adds the number of biking and walking trips for exercise, rideshare app use and rideshare service from the last month, usual mode of travel for getting to school, and the use of the travel log on the days trips were taken. All data collected for workers used the same categories in 2009 and 2017- whether the job was full-time or part-time, if the person worked more than one job, the category of the occupation, the workplace location, the typical mode used to travel to work, whether workers drove alone or carpooled, the typical distance traveled to get to work, the typical travel time to work, whether the person works from home, usual arrivel time at work, and flexibility in time of arrival at work. The vehicle data includes car make, model, and age, the amount of miles driven annually, how long the vehicle has been owned, the vehicle odometer reading, whether the vehicle uses alternative fuel, and who the primary driver is. The 2009 NHTS states whether the vehicle is commercially owned, and the 2017 NHTS lists vehicle body type, fuel type, and hybrid type for hybrid vehicles. Trip data includes origin and destination addresses, tip start and end times,trip distance, trip purpose, travel party size, the last time of travel, and the means of transportation including vehicle type, which household vehicle is used, wait time for transit, and access and egress mode for transit. The 2009 NHTS includes additional data for interstate use and toll payment. Important categories within the given data include rideshare app use, actual rideshare service use, transit use, and means of travel. Other data may be used to provide clarity to trends shown within the data. "],
["data-analysis.html", "Chapter 5 Data Analysis", " Chapter 5 Data Analysis The data for trips taken in the 2009 NHTS show that relatively low amounts of trips were taken using public transit modes.
