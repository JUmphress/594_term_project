<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Literature Review</h1>
<p>Ridesharing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi have become an increasingly popular mode of transportation within the last few years. Ridesharing allows travelers to digitally hail drivers and pay for rides, usually by using a smartphone app. Ridesharing fits into a unique niche as a transportation mode. It provides many advantages typically offered by car ownership but bypasses the cost of buying a car or other inconveniences such as finding parking. It offers a much higher level of convenience than taxis or traditional transit forms such as buses or trains by picking up and dropping off riders at the desired locations, often at competitive prices. This literature seeks to understand the work that has been done to understand the relationship between ridesharing use and transit use.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Large-Scale Ridesourcing Trends</h2>
<p>Observation of ridesharing on a broad scale can identify general trends between ridesharing and transit ridership. <span class="citation">@diab2020rise</span> studied the effects of various factors on transit ridership in Canada. Data were collected from a wide range of sources and used to generate three models- one for all transit agencies in Canada, one for the agencies with over 1.2 million linked trips in 2016, and one for agencies with less than 1.2 million linked trips in 2016. Variation was studied within agencies over time and between agencies at the same times. Variables within the model were selected based on statistically significant correlations. The models suggest that overall, the presence of Uber in areas with large transit systems is correlated with small increases in transit ridership, but in areas with smaller transit systems this is correlated with a decrease in transit ridership. Based on this study, it is not completely clear whether ridesharing directly affects transit use or if conditions that negatively impact transit use also happen to be more beneficial for ridesharing. Areas with higher transit availability will naturally receive higher ridership, but if transit is more available for reasons such as higher population density, it also stands to reason that ridesharing would also be a popular mode choice in the same area. Similarly, ridership will decrease in areas with less coverage, while ridesharing does not face the same problems with long headways. However, though the changes to ridership associated with ridesharing are small, ridesharing is among the more statistically significant variables in the model.</p>
<p><span class="citation">@leard2020does</span> used the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) to create a choice model that would estimate mode choices if ridesharing were no longer an option. Ridesharing was identified as primarily replacing driving cars, though it did also have effects on other modes such as biking and taxi riding. The biggest cost to transit systems was shown in some larger cities, where ridesharing replaced more transit usage than individual car rides. This contrasts the conclusions drawn by Diab et al., where the presence of ridesharing had some minor benefit for large transit systems but also tended to detract from smaller transit systems. However, other large cities confirm the results from Diab et al., as ridesharing almost exclusively replaced car driving. These differences are likely due to differences in mode preference habits and existing mode options in the cities tested.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Ridesourcing Trends in Cities</h2>
<p>Studying rideshare uses in specific areas can provide greater clarity on specific relationships. <span class="citation">@welch2020shared</span> compared train, bikeshare, and taxi use in the Washington, DC metropolitan region, with ridesharing classified within the taxi category due to limits in available data on ridesharing. Competition with the local transit system was isolated by identifying bikeshare and taxi trips that had both origins and destinations within a quarter-mile radius of train stops. Multinomial logit modelling indicated that increases in train fare significantly increased the likelihood of travelers choosing bikeshare or taxi as a travel mode. Trains were still the most commonly used mode, followed by taxis and then bikeshares. Train ridership was much heavier in peak periods than the other modes, while taxi usage became the dominant mode during evening non-peak periods. Furthermore, train ridership was primarily used for work commutes, while bikesharing and taxi were more likely to be used for other types of trips.</p>
<p><span class="citation">@zgheib2020modeling</span> studied the potential for ridesharing as a means of accessing transit services, including addressing the first-mile last-mile problem. Data was collected through a survey in preparation for the installation of a bus rapid transit (BRT) system in the Beirut area in Lebanon. This data was then used to create a mode choice model. Model results suggested that in-vehicle travel time using ridesharing services were less preferable than similar amounts of in-vehicle travel time on BRT. However, ridesharing was still viewed as more reliable than BRT. Ridesharing was more popular among younger populations. Unfortunately, the survey only included travelers who already owned cars, making it impossible to estimate the effects of ridesharing on those who might typically rely more heavily on transit.</p>
<p><span class="citation">@mohamed2020utilisation</span> conducted a study in London by issuing detailed surveys to UberX and Uberpool riders. Like the study conducted by <span class="citation">@zgheib2020modeling</span>, survey data showed that ridesharing is used primarily by younger people, with the vast majority of UberX riders and over half of Uberpool riders under the age of 36, and a low fraction of riders in their fifties or older. Social activities were named as the leading trip attraction for rideshare users, with work being the next most common attraction. The survey results suggest that in London, rideshare users primarily used public transit prior to ridesharing. While the relationship between transit and rideshare use when traveling in a large urban area is still unclear as shown by <span class="citation">@leard2020does</span>, Londonâ€™s well-established transit network was generally the preferred mode of choice, so it stands to reason that ridesharing would draw more riders from public transit than from driving. The three main reasons for choosing ridesharing were speed, not travelling with strangers, and reliability, all of which are common complaints against transit.</p>
<p><span class="citation">@brown2020and</span> studied ridesharing patterns in Los Angeles county in California using data from Lyft. Two models were created, one searching for patterns in locations involved in ridesharing and one searching for patterns in the types of individuals who used ridesharing services. Ridesharing was more common in medium- and high-density neighborhoods, and it was more common in low-income neighborhoods than medium- or high-income neighborhoods. Brown also confirmed <span class="citation">@zgheib2020modeling</span> and <span class="citation">@mohamed2020utilisation</span> in observing that ridesharing was more common among younger riders than older riders. Brown also observed that the majority of Lyft trips were taken by a minority of Lyft users, or in other words, a small group of individuals frequently rideshare while a larger group of individuals may occasionally rideshare.</p>
<p><span class="citation">@kong2020does</span> studied ridesharing patterns in Chengdu, China, for the ridesharing company Didi. In addition to data from Didi, information was gathered regarding the public transit system and the built environment. Like the study conducted by <span class="citation">@welch2020shared</span> in Washington, DC, Kong et al.Â identified ridesharingâ€™s potential to replace transit by tracking origins and destinations that were similar in location to transit stops. In addition to transit coverage, travel times and service quality were considered when evaluating whether ridesharing complemented or replaced transit. Based on the time of day for trips taken, it was observed that during the day (7:00 am to 8:00 pm) ridesharing mostly took place within close proximity to public transit stops, while for the rest of the time ridesharing complemented public transit by travelling to more obscure locations. Ridesharing was concluded to decrease transit ridership in areas with greater coverage, but it complemented transit ridership in areas with poorer coverage. Overall, an average of about one-third of Didi trips were identified as likely replacements for transit. Day travel is more likely to see Didi replace transit than night travel is.</p>
<p>Overall, a wide range of factors seem to affect the relationship between ridesharing and public transit use. Data such as rider age, public transit coverage, time of day, and many other pieces of information all relate to how ridesharing is used.</p>
